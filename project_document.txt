             PRIORITY SCHEDULING
             ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

in struct thread
(1) struct lock *wait_on_lock;
-purpose: For nested donation, wait_on_lock acts as an intermediary between threads. 
ex)  thread A <-(holder) lockA <- (wait_on_lock)  <- thread B <-(holder) lockB (wait_on_lock) <- thread C        

(2) struct list donations;
-purpose: Through this list, when one of multiple locks is released, the priorities are compared and donated again with the highest priority.

(3) struct list_elem d_elem;
-purpose: list_elem for donations list           

>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
>> Use ASCII art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a
>> .png file.)

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?
(1) sema_down
In the sema_down function, putting things into the waiter list through list_push_back was changed to be 
in descending order based on the priority of the thread through the list_inserted_ordered function.

(2) sema_up
By sorting the waiter list before thread_unblock, it covers cases where the priorities of threads may have changed in the waiter list.
And since front has the highest priority in the descending waiter list, when sema_up wake up thread,
front is taken out and removed at the same time through the list_pop_front function.

(3) cond_wait and cond_signal
An algorithm similar to (1) and (2) is used.
The difference is that the semaphore puts a thread structure in the waiter list, but the condition variable puts a semaphore_elem structure.
So the cmp function used is different.
cmp_priority can directly compare thread's priority through list_entry,
but cmp_cond_priority have to compare thread's priority through  semaphore.watiers, a member of semphore_elem, as a parameter of list_front

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?
If the lock's holder has a lower priority than the thread that currently called the lock_acquire() function,
the caller donates priority to the holder.
The maximum value of nested is set to 10, so the for statement is run a maximum of 10 times.
At this time, access(iteration) is made through the wait_on_lock variable in order to donate to the threads nesting the lock.
ex) l(wait_on_lock)->holder->priority = cur->priority  and next => l = l->holder->wait_on_lock and if l == NULL mean front thread in nested donation
In nested donations, the thread that always performs lock_acquire() last will inevitably have a higher priority than the thread in front of it.
This is because the thread at the front always receives the donation, but the fact that another thread is allocated the CPU means that a thread with a higher priority than this priority has locked_aquire even though it has received the donation.

>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid
>> this race?

>> C3: Did any ambiguities in the scheduler specification make values

               SURVEY QUESTIONS
               ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future quarters or the remaining projects?

>> Any other comments?
